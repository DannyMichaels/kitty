### Kitty üêà
Just a silly Front-End React Website I made. <br />
Link: https://kity.netlify.app 

## Features
- Get a random cat image by clicking on the button on the homepage (calling an API)
- Add your cat to the cat gallery so people can see (posting to an API)
- Play Cat-Mouse-Toe! (Tic-Tac-Toe)

## Styling
I'm going for a black/white type of feel. 
Right now not much is going on but I'll add more to it later

## Ideas
- I'm thinking of adding a dark mode button to the page.
- I'm thinking of adding a "virtual pet", sort of "tamagochi" style, and associate it to an authenticated user, you'll be able to feed it, play games to get currency to feed it, etc.
