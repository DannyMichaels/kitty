### Kitty
Just a silly Front-End React Website I made.

## Features
- Get a random cat image by clicking on the button on the homepage (calling an API)
- Add your cat to the cat gallery so people can see!
- Play Cat-Mouse-Toe! (Tic-Tac-Toe)

## Styling
I'm going for a black/white type of feel. 
Right now not much is going on but I'll add more to it later

## Ideas
- I'm thinking of adding a dark mode button to the page.
- Maybe have a UX Designer help with further styling.
